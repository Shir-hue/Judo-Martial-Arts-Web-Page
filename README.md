A static website for a Judo Martial Arts Web featuring multiple pages with dedicated styling. 

## Project Journey 🌱
This website represents my first major foray into web development as part of my school curriculum. When I began this project:
- I started with minimal coding experience
- Focused exclusively on front-end fundamentals (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Learned through hands-on implementation
- Developed problem-solving skills through trial and error
- Refrained from using bootstrap for better experience
- Finished project Nov,2024.. March, 2025 GitHub publication with version control implementation

As my first full-scale frontend project, this represents both my technical growth and dedication to continuous learning. While reflecting my early-stage capabilities, it fuels my ambition to develop more complex applications using modern stacks like React/Tailwind in my future projects.
Though this is an early academic project, it marks my significant progress in my technical abilities. I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and create more sophisticated applications in the future!
