**Overview**
This project was created to demonstrate my understanding of fundamental web development practices. Built without the use of front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap, the focus was placed on manual implementation of layout, styling, and interactivity—providing a deeper learning experience in core web technologies.

🎯 **Objectives**
- Develop a functional, multi-page website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Design a professional UI with responsive behavior across devices
- Implement interactive elements without relying on external libraries
- Practice real-world project organization, version control, and GitHub deployment


🌐 **Live Demo**
Deployed on GitHub Pages:

🗂 **Site Structure**
The website consists of five main sections:

/html/home.html — Landing Page <br>
/html/classes.html — Overview of Judo Programs <br>
/html/trainers.html — Instructor Profiles <br>
/html/memberships.html — Membership Plans <br>
/html/contact.html — Contact Form and Location Details <br>


   **Key Features**
- Clean, semantic HTML structure for readability and accessibility
- Page-specific CSS styling for modular visual design
- Responsive layout across desktop, tablet, and mobile views
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity and client-side validation
- Organized project structure for scalability and maintenance
- No external frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap), all components built manually
